# Objective
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The report gains global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. This project allows us to gain insight into the state of happiness in the world today.

# Contextual Descriptive Analysis
## Cardinality and Count
Some countries' happiness rankings have improved, some have remained stable, and others have declined. More countries have seen an improvement than a decline, with stable countries in between. Countries that have improved may have experienced economic, social, or political improvements, while stable countries tend to have strong support systems and low corruption. Countries that have declined have experienced significant drops in their rankings, with examples ranging from Japan to Zimbabwe.
